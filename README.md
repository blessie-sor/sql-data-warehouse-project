# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

This project focuses on designing and implementing a Data Warehouse solution, leveraging a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using data sourced from CSV files.  
The primary goal is to transform raw CSV data into a structured format suitable for analytics, and to derive actionable business insights that drive better decision-making.
